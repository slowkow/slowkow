### Hi there, I'm Kamil ðŸ‘‹ 

I work as a biomedical researcher at [Mass General Brigham][1], where I focus
on statistical analysis for projects that involve millions of cells from
hundreds of patient samples. My expertise is in the field of genomics and
immunology, and more specifically in the analysis of single-cell
transcriptomics data. In other words, I study data that tells us what cells are
doing at the molecular level, and I compare the cells from different people to
find out what might be happening in the context of diseases like rheumatoid
arthritis, immunotherapy-related colitis, and COVID-19.

I am interested to hear about 100% remote work opportunities, so please feel
free to get in touch.

I believe that it is important to make data easily accessible to all of my
current and future collaborators. This motivates me to create bespoke websites
that enable visitors to browse the datasets that I analyze. My favorite way to
make these kinds of websites is with vanilla client-side Javascript.
